# Advanced DynamoDB Patterns

üöÄ **Learn key DynamoDB techniques for better performance**

## Module Overview

Master essential DynamoDB patterns that improve performance and prevent common issues in your applications.

### What You'll Learn

- **Batch Operations**: Process multiple items efficiently
- **Conditional Updates**: Prevent data conflicts and race conditions
- **Query Optimization**: Get better performance from your queries

### Key Benefits

- **Better Performance**: Reduce API calls and latency
- **Data Safety**: Prevent overselling and data corruption  
- **Cost Efficiency**: Use fewer request units
- **Free Tier Friendly**: Maximize value within limits

## Core Patterns

### 1. Batch Operations
Process multiple items in single API calls:
```text
‚ùå Single: 100 separate API calls
‚úÖ Batch: 4 API calls (25 items each)
```

### 2. Conditional Updates
Prevent race conditions:
```text
‚ùå Without conditions: Two users buy last item
‚úÖ With conditions: Only first user succeeds
```

## Module Contents
