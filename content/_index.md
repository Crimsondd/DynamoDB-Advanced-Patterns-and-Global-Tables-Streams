# DynamoDB Advanced Patterns Building Multi-Region Architectures with Global Tables and Streams

#### Overview
In this comprehensive workshop, you will be building a **Multi-Region E-commerce Platform** using DynamoDB Advanced Patterns and AWS Free Tier. You will learn **Single Table Design**, implement **Global Tables** for multi-region replication, and build **real-time stream processing** with Lambda. \
Finally, we will implement comprehensive **monitoring and optimization** strategies while maintaining strict cost control within Free Tier limits.

#### Single Table Design
**Single Table Design** is a DynamoDB modeling approach where you store multiple entity types in one table using composite keys. This pattern optimizes for performance and cost by reducing the number of requests and leveraging DynamoDB's partition-based architecture. When implemented correctly, it provides sub-millisecond query performance while minimizing capacity consumption.

{{% notice note %}}
As a best practice, design your access patterns first before creating your table structure. Single Table Design requires careful planning of partition keys (PK) and sort keys (SK) to support all your query patterns efficiently. This workshop uses a proven e-commerce data model that supports 6 optimized access patterns while staying within Free Tier limits.

#### Global Tables Multi-Region
**Global Tables** provide fully managed multi-region, multi-active database replication. Data written to any region is automatically replicated to all other regions within seconds. This enables you to build globally distributed applications with local read and write access, improving performance and providing disaster recovery capabilities.

#### DynamoDB Streams & Lambda
**DynamoDB Streams** capture data modification events in your table in near real-time. When combined with **AWS Lambda**, you can build event-driven architectures that automatically process changes, update derived data, send notifications, or trigger business workflows. This pattern is essential for building reactive, scalable applications.

#### Global Secondary Indexes (GSI)
**Global Secondary Indexes** allow you to query your data using different access patterns than your main table. GSIs have their own partition and sort keys, enabling efficient queries across different dimensions of your data. Proper GSI design is crucial for performance optimization and cost control.

#### Monitoring & Cost Optimization
**CloudWatch monitoring** provides real-time visibility into your DynamoDB performance, capacity utilization, and costs. Combined with **billing alerts** and **Free Tier tracking**, you can ensure optimal performance while maintaining strict cost control. This workshop implements comprehensive monitoring dashboards and automated alerting.

#### Free Tier Compliance
**AWS Free Tier** provides generous limits for learning and experimentation. This workshop is designed to use only 60% of available Free Tier resources, ensuring zero cost while providing enterprise-grade learning experience. All participants will implement production-ready patterns without incurring any charges.
