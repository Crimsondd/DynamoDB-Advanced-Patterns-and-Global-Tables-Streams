# Single Table Design Implementation

ðŸ“Š **Learn how to implement DynamoDB Single Table Design patterns for optimal performance and cost efficiency**

## Overview

- Single Table Design is a revolutionary approach to data modeling in DynamoDB. Instead of using multiple tables like in relational databases, we store all entity types (Users, Products, Orders) in one table using composite keys for relationships.

## Why Single Table Design?

#### Traditional Relational Approach Problems:
- **Multiple tables** = Multiple queries = Higher latency
- **JOINs are expensive** and not available in DynamoDB
- **Inconsistent performance** across different query patterns
- **Higher costs** from managing multiple tables

#### DynamoDB Single Table Benefits:
- **Single query** retrieves related data
- **Consistent performance** across all access patterns
- **Lower costs** with fewer tables and operations
- **Atomic transactions** across entity types

## Learning Objectives
#### By the end of this module, you will:

- âœ… Understand Single Table Design principles and benefits
- âœ… Design composite keys (PK + SK) for multiple entity types
- âœ… Create and query data using DynamoDB Console
- âœ… Implement Global Secondary Indexes (GSI) for flexible access patterns
- âœ… Analyze performance metrics and costs

## Module Duration: 90 minutes

- **Theory**: 20 minutes - Core concepts and principles
- **Demo**: 25 minutes - Console navigation and data creation
- **Hands-on**: 35 minutes - Create your own e-commerce data
- **Review**: 10 minutes - Performance analysis and Q&A

## E-commerce Data Model Overview

#### We'll build a simplified e-commerce platform with these entities:

| PK | SK | Entity | Data |
|---|---|---|---|
| **USER#user1** | **PROFILE** | User | name, email, phone |
| **USER#user1** | **ORDER#ord1** | Order | status, total, date |
| **PRODUCT#p1** | **DETAILS** | Product | name, price, category |
| **ORDER#ord1** | **ITEM#p1** | OrderItem | quantity, price, product |

## Access Patterns We'll Implement

| Pattern | Description | Query Method |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| **1** | Get user profile | PK = USER#id, SK = PROFILE |
| **2** | Get user's orders | PK = USER#id, SK begins_with ORDER# |
| **3** | Get order details with items | PK = ORDER#id |
| **4** | Get products by category | GSI1: CATEGORY# queries |
| **5** | Get products by price range | GSI2: PRICE# queries |
| **6** | Get orders by status | GSI2: STATUS# queries |

## Key Concepts

#### Composite Keys Strategy
- **Partition Key (PK)**: Groups related items together
- **Sort Key (SK)**: Enables range queries and relationships
- **GSI Keys**: Enable additional query patterns

#### Entity Namespacing
- **USER#**: All user-related data
- **PRODUCT#**: All product-related data  
- **ORDER#**: All order-related data
- **CATEGORY#**: Product groupings
- **STATUS#**: Order status groupings

**Design Philosophy**: In Single Table Design, we model our table structure based on **HOW we'll query the data**, not how we'll store it. This is the opposite of relational database design!

## What You'll Build

#### By the end of this module, you'll have created:

- **User profiles** with proper key structure
- **Product catalog** with category and price indexing
- **Order management** with item relationships
- **Efficient queries** using table and GSI patterns
- **Performance insights** from CloudWatch metrics

**Cost Safety**: All exercises use minimal data and stay well within AWS Free Tier limits. Monitor the CloudWatch dashboard to track usage.
